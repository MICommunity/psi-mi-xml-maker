        <h1> Welcome to the PSI-MI XML maker user guide </h1>
    </header>

    <main>
        <h1> Introduction </h1>
        <h3>What is the PSI-MI XML maker?</h3>
        <p> The PSI-MI XML maker is a tool designed to create XML files based on the <a href="https://rawgit.com/HUPO-PSI/miXML/master/3.0/doc/MIF300.html"> PSI-MI 3.0 format </a>.
            Those files can later be input in the editor for further processing.
            </p>
        <h3>What kind of file the PSI-XML maker support?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> CSV (Comma Separated values)</li>
            <li> TSV (Tab Separated values)</li>
            <li> XLSX (Excel format (from 2007))</li>
            <li> XLS (Excel format (before 2007))</li>
        </ul>

        <h1> File processing</h1>

        <h3> 1. File input</h3>
        They are 3 ways to import a file in the PSI-MI XML maker:
        <ul>
            <li> Pressing the File button in the menu bar will lead to an input button which open the file browser.</li>
            <li> Pressing the "Fetch file" button in the "1. Fetch file section" will open the file browser.</li>
            <li> Dragging the wanted file directly into the window.</li>
        </ul>

        <p> Once the file is loaded, enter the publication ID. The XML file will not be created without it.</p>

        <h3> 2. Update the Uniprot ids</h3>
        The second section is not mandatory but recommended. In the case of an XLSX or XLS file, the sheet on which the XML maker is working has to be selected.
        Then, the same way as other formats, the columns will be displayed in the three selectors.
        The user has to select for each selector the corresponding column in the file.
        Once done, a click on the "Update the Uniprot ids" button will launch the process.

        <h3> 3. Create the participants</h3>
        Before creating the interactions, the user has to create the participants. The same way as the Uniprot update,
        the user has to select the sheet for the XLSX or XLSX file. Then the user has to associate the participant's
        elements to the columns in the file.
        The application is by default selecting the column with the most resemblance to the needed data,
        but it is necessary for the user to check if the value is correct. It can be done thanks to the preview lines.

        <h3> 4. Create the PSI-MI 3.0 XML file</h3>
        The user has to select the publication date in the dedicated section.
        Finally, the user has to select the number of interactions per XML file. By default, this value is set at 1000.
        If there is more than this number of interactions, multiple files will be generated.
        The user can choose the name and the saving location of the XML file(s).
        By default, the name will be the same as the input file with "_[n of file]" and the saving directory will be also named like the input file.
        Clicking on the "Browse..." button will open the saving file browser.
        Once those requirements filed, clicking on the "Create XML file" button will write and save the XML file.
